# Dreambooth LoRA Demo

This code is prepared for [ICoiCT 2025](https://2025.icoict.org/) demo

**Generating Images from Your Photos Using Diffusion Models and LoRA Fine-tuning**

This tutorial/workshop provides a practical guide to generating new images from your personal photographs using the power of diffusion models and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning. Participants will learn how to prepare their own photo datasets and apply LoRA to adapt pre-trained diffusion models, enabling the creation of unique images that reflect the style and content of their input photos. We will focus on hands-on techniques for training and utilizing LoRA models for personalized image generation. By the end of this session, attendees will have the skills to transform their photo collections into diverse and custom-generated imagery.
